Hi, I'm Michael, and this is my attempt to start a blog about programming and
other half baked ideas. My day job is as a developer at a consultancy firm where
I do mostly web development and business analytics projects. In a past life I
was a Philosophy Grad student specialising in metaphysics and causation. I am a
self taught programmer and I want to be a better programmer, as it is something
that I've come to enjoy in and of itself.
