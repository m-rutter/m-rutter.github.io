Hello, I am Michael and this is my half baked attempt at starting a blog as
though its still 2008. I work as a software developer for a small startup in
London, UK where I mostly do web development. I am a self taught programmer and
I want to be a better programmer as it is something that I've come to enjoy in
and of itself. In a past life I was a philosophy grad student specialising in
metaphysics.

Topics that I am interested in include programming, philosophy, politics,
TypeScript, Rust, Haskell, d3, React, node, film, video games, and board games.
