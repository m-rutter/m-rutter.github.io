I'm Michael and this is my half baked attempt at blogging as though its
still 2008. I work as a software developer in the UK where I mostly do
frontend web development. I am a self taught programmer. In a past life I was a
philosophy post-grad specialising in metaphysics.

Topics that I am interested in include programming, philosophy, politics, video
games, and board games.

Programming langauges wise I'm quite interested in langauges with interesting
type systems like Typescript, Rust, and Haskell.
For my day job I mostly write in TypeScript.

Philosophy wise I was mostly interested in Metaphysics and causation.

Politics wise probably I probably describe myself as member of the near extinct
species of a liberal social democrat. I like Rawls and think we should have
better services and consider things like UBI or other soical guarantees that
just make living more dignified and fair.
